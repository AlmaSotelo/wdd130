         <p>Hi! my name is Alma. I currently am a BYU-Pathway student to become a Software Developer within the next two years. I really love to code and feel glad to take this education. When I'm not sitting at the computer studying, I'm sitting at my sowing machine. I'm pretty tall and I make most of my cloths. I learned to sow since I was a teeneger. I enjoy cleaning my house by myself, cook for my family and to share, planting medical herbs, and playing with my two dogs. I'm a mom, a wife, a sister, and a friend.English is my second language, and I'm fluent in Spanish. I earned a BA in Engeneering from a foraing university. I worked for a construction company for many years as a HR and Safety Coordinator, then I changed gears and got a Web Developer Certificate trhough a bootcamp. I describe myself as a happy forever learner. </p>
